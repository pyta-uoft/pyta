# TODOs for node documentation

## Compare

Same general question as `BinOp` and `BoolOp` about what is actually being stored in `ops`.

Would also be good to have a chained comparison expression like `3 < 4 < 5` documented.

## Comprehension

Should specifically reference other astroid nodes that use `Comprehension`, e.g. `ListComp`.

Should give an example of using an `if`; also, the example seems to contradict the statement that `ifs` is None (rather than an empty list) if there are no `if`s.

Finally, the variable name given in the example documentation is incorrect.

## Const

The description of `value` should really reference the fact that these are literal constants rather than just computed values.
