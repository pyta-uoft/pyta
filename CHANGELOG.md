### üí´ New checkers

Pylint checkers v3.1:

- `use-yield-from`
- `deprecated-attribute`

For more information on these checkers, please see the
[Pylint release notes](http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/whatsnew/index.html). Note that the above
list only contains the Pylint checkers enabled by default in PythonTA.

Custom checkers:

- `inconsistent-returns` and `missing-return-statement`: Provide clearer error messages when reporting missing return statements. This replaces pylint's [R1710](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/messages/refactor/inconsistent-return-statements.html) check.

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Fixed issue with error message of C0410 by reformating it to properly fit with the list of modules imported that are provided to it
- Fixed bug where `_` was marked as a built-in when running PythonTA after running doctest
- Fixed issue where annotated constant variable assignment was not considered as permissible top level code and triggered error E9992
- Fixed issue where top level class attribute assignment was considered as permissible top level code
- Fixed issue where `check_contracts` fails silently when function preconditions contain precondition violations, and when a representation invariant contains a call to a top-level function (not built-in or imported library).
- Fixed issue where methods called in representation invariants lead to infinite recursion.
- Fixed issue where `PossiblyUndefinedChecker` raised an error if the control flow graph was invalid due to syntax error

### üîß Internal changes

## [2.7.0] - 2024-12-14

### ‚ú® Enhancements

- Added new configuration option `use-pyta-error-messages` to let users choose whether PythonTA should overwrite pylint's error messages.
- Both PlainReporter and ColorReporter emphasize specific code chunks by using overline characters under any part that is highlighted as ERROR.
- Added snapshot function for deriving a list of dictionaries containing local variables from relevant functions and/or stack frames.
- Added new configuration option `allow-pylint-comments` to let users choose whether PythonTA should allow comments beginning with pylint: or not.
- `AccumulationTable` can now track variables initialized within the `for` loop. Prior, only variables initialized before the `for` loop could be tracked.
- `AccumulationTable` now stores deep copies of objects rather than shallow copies, thus fixing issues that come up in case of mutation during loop.
- `AccumulationTable` can now take in any accumulator expressions, for eg. `x * 2`, instead of just variables.
- `AccumulationTable` now has an optional initialization argument `output` which allows the users to choose whether they want to write the Accumulation Table to a file.
- Created a `RecursionTable` context manager for recursive tracing using a tabular output.
- Support Python 3.12 (requiring upgrade to pylint and astroid 3.0)

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Fix bug in ending location setting for `Attribute` and `DelAttr` nodes when the same attribute
  was accessed twice on the same line.
- Fix bug where the `naming-convention-violation` checker was checking variables defined in a module's main block. This was inconsistent with the `forbidden-global-variables` checker.
- Fixed bug with `invalid-range-index`: do not attempt any inference of variables in `range` expressions. All range arguments involving variables will be ignored by this checker.

### üí´ New checkers

Pylint checkers v3.0:

- `invalid-field-call`
- `return-in-finally`
- `kwarg-superseded-by-positional-arg`
- `unnecessary-negation` (renamed from `unneeded-not`)

For more information on these checkers, please see the
[Pylint release notes](http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/whatsnew/index.html). Note that the above
list only contains the Pylint checkers enabled by default in PythonTA.

### üîß Internal changes

- Remove experimental type inference code.

## [2.6.4] - 2024-11-10

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Fixed bug with `invalid-range-index` when variables are used in `range` expressions.

## [2.6.3] - 2023-10-09

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Ensure pycodestyle W503, line break before binary operator, is disabled (regression from 2.6.2).
- Fix `check_contracts` typings so PyCharm static checking will work
- Fix `invalid-range-index` bug where valid range calls were flagged as invalid

## [2.6.2] - 2023-09-22

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Fix `naming-convention-violation` bug where `_` was considered an invalid variable name.
- Fix `naming-convention-violation` bug where top-level constants were being checked as regular variable names.

### ‚ú® Enhancements

- Created many custom renderers to make the code snippets for `pep8-errors` easier to understand.

## [2.6.1] - 2023-08-13

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Make `graphviz` an optional dependency, and clarify the installation requirements for visualizing
  control flow graphs.
- Fix `check_contrats` handling of forward references in class type annotations when using `check_contracts` decorator.
- Fix handling of `|` in type annotations (by updating to `typeguard` v4.1.0).

## [2.6.0] - 2023-08-06

### ‚ú® Enhancements

- Can now create control flow graphs using `python_ta.control_flow_graphs` to visualize the
  execution paths of Python code.
- `forbidden-top-level-code` and `forbidden-global-variables` now allow top-level type alias
  assignment statements.
- The `trailing-whitespace` error message now highlights the trailing whitespace.
- The `unnecessary-indexing` error now checks for a greater variety of loop/comprehension indexes.
- Provided configuration files are now merged with PythonTA defaults, so you now only
  need to specify options that you want to be overridden. To ignore PythonTA defaults (the
  old behaviour), pass `load_default_config=False` to `check_errors` and `check_all`.
- Improved the code snippets for the `pep8-errors` "blank line" messages.
  Extra blank lines are now highlighted, and suggestions are added when blank lines are missing.
- The default value of the `pyta-number-of-messages` configuration option is now 0 (changed from 5).
  This causes all error occurrences to be displayed.
- Improved efficiency of the contract-checking custom `setattr` for classes.
- Added new function `python_ta.contracts.validate_invariants` to manually check contracts
  for an object.
- Updated to [pycodestyle v2.11](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/blob/main/CHANGES.txt).

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Fixed bug where running `python3 -m python_ta --generate-config` yields a `FileNotFoundError`.
- Fixed bug in how PythonTA reports error messages that occur when parsing configuration files.
- Ensured some config file parsing errors no longer display incorrect lines in the error report.
- Fixed bug where the `HTMLReporter` and `JSONReporter` would ignore the `pyta-number-of-messages`
  option and always display all error occurrences.
- Fixed bug in `check_contracts` where imported classes were not correctly resolved when checking
  types.
- Fixed bug for class contract-checking when assigning an instance attribute that violates a class
  type constraint or representation invariant. Previously, the instance attribute changed to the
  new value after the error was raised, but now is correctly restored to the original value.
- Remove line double-spacing in PlainReporter and ColorReporter output code snippets.

### üí´ New checkers

Custom checkers:

- `invalid-name-checker`: Provide beginner-friendly error messages when reporting variable names
  that violate Python naming conventions. This replaces pylint's
  [C0103](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/messages/convention/invalid-name.html)
  check.

- Fixed bug in possibly-undefined checker where a comprehension variable is falsely flagged as possibly undefined.
- Fixed bug where `check_errors` and `check_all` opens a webpage when a nonexistent or unreadable path is passed as an argument.
- Fixed the CFG implementation to resolve a bug in the possibly-undefined checker where variables were falsely flagged as possibly undefined when the code conditionally raises an exception and the variable was referenced afterwards.
- Fixed bug where the generated CFGs will highlight the except block as unreachable if the same exception it is handling was raised in the body of the tryexcept.

- Added constant `python_ta.contracts.ENABLE_CONTRACT_CHECKING` to only check contracts when its value is set to `True`.
- `python_ta.debug.AccumulationTable` has extended loop detection to allow the loop to appear anywhere inside the with statement.

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Fixed Issue #831: Contract Checker Bug. Now raises `AssertionError` when the expected type is `float` but got `int` instead.

## [2.0.0] - 2021-08-24

PythonTA's adopting semantic versioning as of this release, so we've bumped the version to 2.0.

### ‚ú® Enhancements

- Added basic CLI. Users can now run PythonTA in the command line either as a standalone
  script (`$ python_ta my_file`) or as a Python module (`$ python -m python_ta my_file`).

  before the for loop.
  ([#699](https://github.com/pyta-uoft/pyta/issues/699))
- Fixed bug where PythonTA would crash on files that used encodings other than UTF-8.
  PythonTA now reports an error and displays the invalid characters to the user.
