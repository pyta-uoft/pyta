# Python TA Statistics

## Purpose

This module has been designed to calculate a series of statistics on a certain
directory of Python files. This directory may be a single student's project
folder, or even the directory of an entire course worth of students' projects.

## Calculated Statistics

`pyta_statistics` computes several statistics, both on the individual
(per student) level, and the course (all students) level.

**_Individual Statistics_**

- Total number of messages of each type (code, style, both)
- Most frequent messages (code & style)
- Most frequent code errors
- Most frequent style errors

(The frequency statistics are presented in both raw and percentage form.)

**_Aggregate Statistics_**

- Five most frequent code errors (number of errors made)
- Average code errors per student
- Five most frequent style errors (number of errors made)
- Average style errors per student
- Five most frequent errors of either type (number of errors made)
- Average errors of either type per student
- "Five Number Summary" on the number of errors per student:
  - Most Errors: number of errors made by the student with the most errors
  - Upper Quartile: 25% of students made at least this many errors
  - Median: the halfway point of errors per student
  - Lower Quartile: 25% of students made fewer than this many errors
  - Least Errors: number of errors made by the student with the least errors

## Instructions

In order to see the statistics for the files in a particular directory,
call `pyta_statistics` on the absolute path to the directory, as so:

```python
>>> directory = "C:\\Users\\prof\\Documents\\course1\\projects"  # for example
>>> from examples.sample_usage.pyta_stats import pyta_statistics          # while running python in the pyta directory
>>> pyta_statistics(directory)
```

The function will then return the compiled statistics, both individual and
aggregate (if it is a course directory).

## Modules

There are three Python files that contribute to the aggregation and calculation
of statistics for Python TA:

- `examples/sample_usage/pyta_stats.py`

  - This module contains the `pyta_statistics` function that users run on the
    directory that they want to analyse. It aggregates statistics that are collected
    by `StatReporter` instances when `python_ta.check_all()` is run, then calls
    the actual statistics calculators contained in the `stats_analysis` module,
    and pretty-prints the results.

- `examples/sample_usage/stats_analysis.py`

  - This module performs all of the actual statistics calculation on data collected
    by `pyta_stats`. The main function, `summary`, takes in the data and calls
    `_individual_calc` on every student/group's lists of errors, and also calls
    helpers to calculate aggregate statistics on the entire directory/course's
    worth of students. It returns all of this to `pyta_stats`, which prints
    the results.

- `python_ta/reporters/stat_reporter.py`
  - This Pylint-style `StatReporter` class is used by `python_ta.check_all()`, which
    in turn calls `pylint`. An instance of `StatReporter` is created for every
    file that is linted, and the errors reported are stored in class-level variables
    that functions in other modules (i.e.: `pyta_statistics`) can then access.
    The class-level variables must be emptied for every new student/group's set
    of files.
    (See Pylint documentation and the Python TA wiki for more on reporters.)
