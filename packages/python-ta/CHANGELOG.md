## Unreleased

### ✨ Enhancements

- Replaced the PyTA logo image data in the HTML report to be embedded directly in the src URL instead of using an external URL, and provided a favicon for the HTML report page using the same svg data.
- Extended `RecursionTable` to handle mutual recursion by taking in a list of function names to trace. Updated table output format correspondingly to include a "function" key column.
- Extended `unnecessary_f_string_checker.py` to present an alternate message when the input is already a string.

[Pylint release notes](http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/whatsnew/index.html). Note that the above
list only contains the Pylint checkers enabled by default in PythonTA.

### 🔧 Internal changes

- Remove experimental type inference code.

## [2.6.4] - 2023-11-10

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fixed bug with `invalid-range-index` when variables are used in `range` expressions.

## [2.6.3] - 2023-10-09

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Ensure pycodestyle W503, line break before binary operator, is disabled (regression from 2.6.2).
- Fix `check_contracts` typings so PyCharm static checking will work
- Fix `invalid-range-index` bug where valid range calls were flagged as invalid

## [2.6.2] - 2023-09-22

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fix `naming-convention-violation` bug where `_` was considered an invalid variable name.
- Fix `naming-convention-violation` bug where top-level constants were being checked as regular variable names.

### ✨ Enhancements

- Created many custom renderers to make the code snippets for `pep8-errors` easier to understand.

## [2.6.1] - 2023-08-13

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Make `graphviz` an optional dependency, and clarify the installation requirements for visualizing
  control flow graphs.
- Fix `check_contrats` handling of forward references in class type annotations when using `check_contracts` decorator.
- Fix handling of `|` in type annotations (by updating to `typeguard` v4.1.0).

## [2.6.0] - 2023-08-06

### ✨ Enhancements

- Can now create control flow graphs using `python_ta.control_flow_graphs` to visualize the
  execution paths of Python code.
- `forbidden-top-level-code` and `forbidden-global-variables` now allow top-level type alias
  assignment statements.
- The `trailing-whitespace` error message now highlights the trailing whitespace.
- The `unnecessary-indexing` error now checks for a greater variety of loop/comprehension indexes.
- Provided configuration files are now merged with PythonTA defaults, so you now only
  need to specify options that you want to be overridden. To ignore PythonTA defaults (the
  old behaviour), pass `load_default_config=False` to `check_errors` and `check_all`.
- Improved the code snippets for the `pep8-errors` "blank line" messages.
  Extra blank lines are now highlighted, and suggestions are added when blank lines are missing.
- The default value of the `pyta-number-of-messages` configuration option is now 0 (changed from 5).
  This causes all error occurrences to be displayed.
- Improved efficiency of the contract-checking custom `setattr` for classes.
- Added new function `python_ta.contracts.validate_invariants` to manually check contracts
  for an object.
- Updated to [pycodestyle v2.11](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/blob/main/CHANGES.txt).

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fixed bug where running `python3 -m python_ta --generate-config` yields a `FileNotFoundError`.
- Fixed bug in how PythonTA reports error messages that occur when parsing configuration files.
- Ensured some config file parsing errors no longer display incorrect lines in the error report.
- Fixed bug where the `HTMLReporter` and `JSONReporter` would ignore the `pyta-number-of-messages`
  option and always display all error occurrences.
- Fixed bug in `check_contracts` where imported classes were not correctly resolved when checking
  types.
- Fixed bug for class contract-checking when assigning an instance attribute that violates a class
  type constraint or representation invariant. Previously, the instance attribute changed to the
  new value after the error was raised, but now is correctly restored to the original value.
- Remove line double-spacing in PlainReporter and ColorReporter output code snippets.

### 💫 New checkers

Custom checkers:

- `invalid-name-checker`: Provide beginner-friendly error messages when reporting variable names
  that violate Python naming conventions. This replaces pylint's
  [C0103](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/messages/convention/invalid-name.html)
  check.

Pylint checkers v2.16:

- `pointless-exception-statement`
- `shadowed-import`
- `unbalanced-dict-unpacking`
- `nested-min-max`
- `invalid-slice-step`

Pylint checkers v2.17:

- `bad-chained-comparison`

For more information on these checkers, please see the
[Pylint release notes](http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/whatsnew/index.html). Note that the above
list only contains the Pylint checkers enabled by default in PythonTA.

## [2.5.0] - 2023-04-27

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fixed bug in possibly-undefined checker where a comprehension variable is falsely flagged as possibly undefined.
- Fixed bug where `check_errors` and `check_all` opens a webpage when a nonexistent or unreadable path is passed as an argument.
- Fixed the CFG implementation to resolve a bug in the possibly-undefined checker where variables were falsely flagged as possibly undefined when the code conditionally raises an exception and the variable was referenced afterwards.
- Fixed bug where the generated CFGs will highlight the except block as unreachable if the same exception it is handling was raised in the body of the tryexcept.

### 💫 New checkers

Custom checkers:

- `forbidden-python-syntax`: Flag code that is not permitted to be used on an assessment.

### 🔧 Internal changes

- Pin dependency versions

## [2.4.2] - 2023-1-31

- Fixed bug in shadowing-in-comprehension checker when target is a subscript node.
- Ensured `check_contracts` and `check_all_contracts` do nothing when `ENABLE_CONTRACT_CHECKING` is `False`.

## [2.4.1] - 2023-1-13

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fixed PyTA contract checking for method calls when running modules in PyCharm using the "Run File in Python Console" action.

## [2.0.0] - 2021-08-24

PythonTA's adopting semantic versioning as of this release, so we've bumped the version to 2.0.

### ✨ Enhancements

- Added basic CLI. Users can now run PythonTA in the command line either as a standalone
  script (`$ python_ta my_file`) or as a Python module (`$ python -m python_ta my_file`).

- Fixed bug with `unnecessary-indexing` checker: handle case where loop variable is first assigned
  before the for loop.
  ([#699](https://github.com/pyta-uoft/pyta/issues/699))
- Fixed bug where PythonTA would crash on files that used encodings other than UTF-8.
  PythonTA now reports an error and displays the invalid characters to the user.

### 🚧 Deprecations

- Deprecated `pyta-reporter` option; use `output-format` instead.
