## print_nodes.py

### print_nodes function

    # To fix:

    AnnAssign Node:
        An AttributeError is raised because the transformer did not add
        'end_lineno' attribute to the AnnAssign node. In the current example
        found in `examples/nodes/ann_assign.py`, only the last statement has the
        'end_lineno' attribute added to it.

    DictUnpack Node:
        An AttributeError is raised because the transformer did not augment this
        node with the ending columns/line attribute. I tried adding this node to
        the NODES_WITHOUT_CHILDREN variable in `setendings.py` but it only added
        the incorrect column offset.
